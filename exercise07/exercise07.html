              <b>Shrek:</b> Well, I'm through with you.<br />
              <b>Donkey:</b> Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Wll, guess that! Now it's my turn!
              So you just shut up and pay attention! You're mean to me. You insult me and you don't
              appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.<br />
              <b>Shrek:</b> Oh yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?<br />
              <b>Donkey:</b> Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!<br />
              <b>Shrek:</b> Oh yeah, you're right, Donkey. I forgive you... For stabbing me in the back!<br />

              <b>Donkey: </b>Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really something back there. Incredible!<br />
              <b>Shrek:</b> Are you talking to... me?<br />
              <b>Shrek:</b> Are you talking to me?<br />
              <b>Donkey: </b>Yes, I was talking to you. Can I tell you was great back there? Those guards!
              They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam!
              They was tripping over themselves like babes in the woods. That's really made me feel good to see that.<br />
              <b>Shrek: </b>Oh, that's great. Really.<br />
              <b>Donkey:</b> Man, it's good to be free.<br />
              <b>Shrek: </b>Now, why don't you go to celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?<br />
              <b>Donkey:</b> But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself.<br />
