									<h3><b>Age:</b> 15</h3>
									<h3><b>Price:</b> $2,500</h3>
									<br>
									<p><b>Facts about Dexter:</b> Prefer's socializing with males, very needy.</p>
									<p><b>Facts about all Goffin's Cockatoos:</b> Goffin’s cockatoos are not shy birds.
										Like a typical cockatoo, most enjoy being held and petted, and are friendly and sociable.
										Goffin’s can also be a bit mischievous and are quick learners. Don’t be surprised to find
										that your Goffin’s cockatoo quickly learns to open the cage after seeing you unlatch the lock.
									</p>
									<p>
										Also called the Tanimbar corella, the Goffin’s cockatoo is the smallest of the white cockatoos,
										and are about 12 inches long from head to tail. It is most likely to be mistaken for a bare-eyed
										cockatoo (or little corella) because of their similar appearance.
									</p>
									<p>
										Goffin’s are mainly white with salmon-colored feathers around the eyes and beak, and the deeper
										 feathers in the crest and around the neck are also salmon colored.
										 The undersides of the Goffin’s wing and tail feathers have a yellowish tinge.

									<h3><b>Age:</b> 2</h3>
									<h3><b>Price:</b> $550</h3>
									<br>
									<p><b>Facts about Rio:</b> Loving and playful.</p>
									<p><b>Facts about all Son Conures:</b> The sun conure is one of the more popular conures of its
										size due to its stunning plumage, its extraordinary disposition, and its exceptional quality
										as a companion bird. Sun conures are lively, vocal, and expressive; this is a bird best known
										for its beauty and its big mouth. The sun conure is approximately 12 inches long, and is
										most recognizable by its bright orange and yellow coloring, often mottled here and there
										with splotches of green.
									</p>
									<p>
										The sun conure has a black beak, white rings around its eyes, and a long, tapering tail.
										The sunny’s striking coloration and sweet temperament makes it a favorite among pet owners
										and a darling with experienced aviculturists because it is easily bred. Immature birds do
										not reach their full coloration for about two years. Though the coloration between the sexes
										is very similar, the males are said to be slightly brighter. Males are also said to have a
										squarer, flatter head and females a rounder, smaller head, though only experienced breeders
										are good at eyeing the birds and making an educated guess. Certainly there’s no difference
										in pet quality.

                  <h3><b>Breed:</b> Scarlet Macaw</h3>
									<h3><b>Age:</b> 7</h3>
									<h3><b>Price:</b> $3,000</h3>
									<br>
									<p><b>Facts about Rose:</b> Loves being outside.</p>
									<p><b>Facts about all Scarlet Macaws:</b> There’s nothing flashier than a scarlet macaw,
										making it a popular large bird among fanciers and novices alike. It’s not unusual for someone
										to begin his or her pet bird journey with a scarlet, though this bird is often not a great
										choice for the novice. The scarlet is just so gorgeous and filled with personality, it’s
										tough for someone with a few extra bucks in their pocket to refuse.
									</p>
									<p>
										The scarlet ranges in size from 32 to 39 inches in length, and is primarily red, as its name implies,
										with a band of yellow in the center of the wings, followed by a band of blue leading to the flight feathers.
										In some birds, there may be a band of green where the yellow meets the blue. Some people confuse the scarlet
										and the green-winged macaw, though there are prominent differences. The green-winged, in general,
										is a much larger bird and has a large band of green on the wing. The primary difference,
										however, is in the face – the scarlet has a naked face, and the green winged macaw has tiny
										red lines of feathers circling down from the eyes onto the face patch. Both birds have a similarly
										colored beak, a black lower mandible and a horn-colored upper mandible (with a little bit of black
										where the two parts of the beak meet).
